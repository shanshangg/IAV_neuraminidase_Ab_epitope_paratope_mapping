Exploration of the relationship between the structural spatial recognition of influenza A virus neuraminidase antigen epitopes and antibodies

Influenza A virus triggers large - scale epidemics across the globe every year, presenting an enormous challenge to public health. Neuraminidase stands as one of the principal targets for the development of anti - influenza A virus drugs and vaccines.In this research, the structural data of antigen - antibody complexes of the neuraminidase protein of influenza A virus were systematically gathered. Subsequently, the key amino acid residues involved in antigen - antibody interactions were statistically analyzed, and the crucial factors during the antibody - neuraminidase protein binding process, such as amino acid usage preference, HCDR3 length, and charge matching, were thoroughly dissected.Furthermore, through the characterization and similarity analysis of the three - dimensional structure of antibody coordination, the structural mechanism of the antibody's specific recognition of antigen epitopes was identified and verified. This work thereby provides a data foundation and viable inspiration for the design and development of antibodies targeting specific sites.

In this study, the epitope and the site numbers and amino acid types of the corresponding antibody - coordinated amino acid residues were extracted, and the distribution of epitope sites on all 37 antigen - antibody complexes was statistically analyzed. Furthermore, the key regions on the NA antigen protein that stimulate the body to produce neutralizing antibodies were located.
